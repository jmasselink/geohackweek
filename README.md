# geohackery

This repository consists of Jupyter Notebook snippets from [Geohackweek 2016](http://geohackweek.github.io/) and [Earth Engine User Summit 2017](https://events.withgoogle.com/google-earth-engine-user-summit-2017/).

For using the Earth Engine Python API, the best option currently includes using docker to control the development environment.

**[Docker Key Terms](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)**
- *Image*: lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

- *Container*: runtime instance of an imageâ€”what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.

#### Instructions

1. Download Docker
> if you have Windows Professional Enterprise, choose [**Docker for Windows**](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).<br>
> if you have Windows Home, choose [**Docker Toolbox**](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).
>>You may need to enable virtualization, which is disabled by default. Follow the [instructions here](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/access-bios-windows-10) to enable virtualization through BIOS.
2. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator

  Pull docker images:
> `docker pull tylere/docker-ee-datascience-notebook`

  Show all docker containers:
> `docker ps -a`

  Start docker container:
> `docker start [container_alias]`

  Stop docker container:
> `docker stop [container_alias]`

  Restart docker container:
> `docker container restart [container_alias]`

  Bind notebooks to environment:
> `docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name docker-ee-datascience-notebook -v "C:/geohackweek/ee_docker/work:/home/jovyan/work" -v "C:/geohackweek/ee_docker/.config/earthengine:/home/jovyan/.config/earthengine" tylere/docker-ee-datascience-notebook`

  Restart docker:
>`"C:/geohackweek/ee_docker/work> docker restart docker-ee-datascience-notebook`

  Launch Jupyter notebook:
> `C:/geohackweek/ee_docker/work>
docker run geohackweek2016/docker-ee-datascience-notebook`

There may be a way to use: `jupyter notebook` to launch directory of notebooks

*To-Do*<br>
Use docker container with additional libraries for visualization of geospatial data in Jupyter Notebooks.
- IPyLeaflet, GeoPandas, Folium (wrapper on Leaflet)
- integrate Jupyter Lab

Here are a few interesting libraries which could be the start of interactive mapping using the Earth Engine Python API
1. [IPyLeaflet](https://github.com/ellisonbg/ipyleaflet)
2. [Folium GEE](https://github.com/mccarthyryanc/folium_gee) binding with [Folium](https://github.com/mccarthyryanc/folium_gee)
